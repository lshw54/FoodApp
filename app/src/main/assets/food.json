      "content": "Scrambled eggs with leeks is a very classic home-cooked dish, and is considered a taste of memory.<br /><br />    Scrambled eggs with leeks is really a very common, home-cooked and flavorful dish. I don't like the soft, couchy leek leaves and flavorless egg pieces in scrambled eggs with leeks. Then improve it; spread the eggs into an egg cake and use it to scramble leeks.<br /><br />    The leeks in general are easy to get watery during the frying process, especially after mixing in the salt, so if the leek leaves and leek stems are added to the pot at the same time it is very easy to cause the leek stems to be cooked, but the leek leaves are soft and mushy. In fact, when stir-frying leeks, the leek stems and leek leaves into the pot separately, first put leek stems slightly stir-fried and then put leek leaves, so you can avoid the phenomenon of leek leaves paste rotten water.<br /><br /><br />    Because of its nutritional value, leek is a warming tonic for the liver and kidneys, and helps to strengthen the essence of Yang, so it is known as the \"Yang-raising herb\" in the pharmacopoeia. It has been cultivated in China for more than 3,000 years and is a vegetable of great nutritional value. Leeks are not only tender and pungent, but also rich in nutrients. Chinese medicine believes that leeks are sweet and warm in taste and have the effect of tonifying the kidneys and benefiting the yang, dispersing blood and detoxifying the body, harmonizing the internal organs, warming the stomach, warming the appetite, and removing dampness and blood. Eating leeks and eggs together harmonizes yin and yang and has a significant toning effect on the body. It nourishes the liver and makes people more energetic. Eating more eggs may lead to higher cholesterol, but the sulfide in leeks can lower blood lipids.",
